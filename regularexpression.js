// Regular expressions are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. You create patterns to help you do that matching. 



let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex; // Change this line

let myString = "Hello, World!";
let myRegex = /Hello/;
let result = myRegex.test(myString);
